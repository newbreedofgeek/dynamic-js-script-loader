Dynamic JS Script Loader
========================

Dynamically loads an array of JS files and executes a callback when all JS files are fully loaded and are ready to be used. 

Very useful for:
----------

* Large projects that depend on many JS files or have files that are tightly coupled.

* Apps where JS files are broken off into smaller manageable modules which are separate JS files and need all modules to be loaded before the app can start

* Adding environment customization like language support etc
